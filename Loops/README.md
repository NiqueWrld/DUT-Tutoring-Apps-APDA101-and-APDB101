| **Name**                    | **Objective**                                                                                                                                                       | **Link**                        |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Number Display**          | Create a Windows Form with a Button and a ListBox. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to display numbers 1 to 100 in the ListBox.                           | [Number Display](./NumberDisplay)  |
| **Sum Calculator**          | Design a form with two TextBox controls for the user to enter a range (start and end numbers) and a Button. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in that range and display the result in a Label. | [Sum Calculator](./SumCalculator) |
| **Multiplication Table Generator** | Create a form with a TextBox for input, a Button, and a ListBox. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to generate and display the multiplication table for the number entered in the TextBox. | [Multiplication Table](./MultiplicationTable) |
| **Prime Number Finder**     | Implement a form with two TextBox controls to input a range (start and end numbers), a Button, and a ListBox. When the button is clicked, use nested for loops to find and display all prime numbers within that range. | [Prime Number Finder](./PrimeNumberFinder) |
| **Factorial Calculator**    | Build a form with a TextBox for input, a Button, and a Label. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to calculate the factorial of the entered number and display the result in the Label. | [Factorial Calculator](./FactorialCalculator) |
| **Reverse String**          | Create a form with a TextBox, a Button, and a Label. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to reverse the string entered in the TextBox and display the reversed string in the Label. | [Reverse String](./ReverseString) |
| **Countdown Timer**         | Develop a form with a Label, a Button, and a Timer. Use a for loop within the Timer tick event to count down from 10 to 0 and update the Label with the current count. | [Countdown Timer](./CountdownTimer) |
| **Array of Names**          | Design a form with a ListBox and a Button. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to add an array of predefined names to the ListBox.                            | [Array of Names](./ArrayOfNames) |
| **Average Score Calculator**| Create a form with five TextBox controls for entering scores, a Button, and a Label. When the button is clicked, use a for loop to calculate and display the average score in the Label. | [Average Score Calculator](./AverageScoreCalculator) |
| **Pattern Generator**       | Implement a form with a TextBox for input, a Button, and a ListBox. When the button is clicked, use nested for loops to generate and display a pattern (e.g., a pyramid of asterisks) in the ListBox based on the number entered in the TextBox. | [Pattern Generator](./PatternGenerator) |
